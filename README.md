It tries to be reasonably thorough to convey the concept, but there are lots of holes and details to sort through, and none of it has undergone any kind of legal review.

# The Commonhaus Foundation in Partnership with the Open Source Collective

Inspired by both [The Codehaus][codehaus] and the values of the [Open Source Collective (OSC)][osc], The Commonhaus Foundation seeks to foster co-creation and mutual support. Our vision is a neutral environment where projects shine, and longevity, security, and innovation intersect.

## Goals

**Content Creation**: In alignment with the OSC's mission to empower creators, we champion innovative tools, libraries, and frameworks, arming our community for success.

**Ecosystem Health**: Driven by sustainability and the OSC's dedication, we focus on the security, longevity, and accessibility of Commonhaus projects.

**Open Source Assurance**: We promise our community that all code under our umbrella remains open source, consistently available in trusted repositories like Maven Central.

**Project Autonomy**: We empower project maintainers with governance freedom. Our foundation rejects 'pay-to-play' and reduces administrative burdens.

## Unique Characteristics

**Preservation of Project Identity**: While many foundations blend projects into a primary brand, Commonhaus projects maintain their distinct identities. Donated domain names and trademarks don't overshadow the project's original flavor. Your project remains unmistakably yours.

**Simplified Governance with Core Principles**: Our governance is straightforward, emphasizing:

- **Transparency**: No matter your governance style, we welcome it. We simply ask for clarity. Make your project's processes clear for all participants.

- **[Succession Planning][succession]**: For project longevity and in tune with the OSC's vision, we require administrative rights. This ensures that projects flourish even if original leaders step away.

**Empowerment Over Enforceability:** The Commonhaus Foundation and the OSC prioritize support over restriction. We aim to uplift each project, acting as guides rather than gatekeepers.

## Focus of The Commonhaus Foundation

**Action Over Deliberation:** Following the OSC's proactive strategy, we prefer tangible outcomes over prolonged discussions. Our passion lies in hands-on, code-focused projects, especially **Application Frameworks** and **Libraries**.

We respect the importance of **Specifications & Standards** and **Discussion-Centric Groups** but choose to direct our energies elsewhere.

## Community Affiliation

**No Pay-to-Play:** Echoing the OSC's principles, we eliminate financial barriers to entry.

**Volunteer Leaders:** Our [council][council] comprises leaders, library champions, and community pillars, reflecting a true collective spirit.

**Licensing:** Our commitment is to open-source licensing as defined by the OSI. For more details, refer to [The Commonhaus Foundation IP Policy Guidance][ip-policy-guidance]).

### Sponsorship Dynamics:

With a foundation in OSC's transparency values, our sponsorship approach revolves around open communication and meaningful actions.

**Direct Project Support:** Your contributions directly benefit project maintainers, fostering a vibrant ecosystem.

**Foundation Support:** Supporting The Commonhaus Foundation amplifies our joint potential with the OSC to bolster projects and key ecosystem pillars.
